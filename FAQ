FAQ:

1. How do I override the default theme ?
    - Go to flow's data directory, check where it is in "About" dialog, it's (~/.local/share/KDAB/flow/) on Linux
    - Add a Style.qml file there, you can now override style properties.
    - The complete list of properties is at: https://github.com/iamsergio/flow-pomodoro/blob/master/src/qml/DefaultStyle.qml

    Example file:

        import QtQuick 2.0
        import "qrc:/qml/"

        DefaultStyle {
            slackingText: "Flow" // Override "You're slacking" text
        }

    For mobile you'll want to inherit from MobileStyle instead of DefaultStyle.

2. How do I change the default title ("You're slacking") to something else ?
   Use the example file from question 1.
