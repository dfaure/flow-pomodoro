FAQ:

1. How do I override the default theme ?
    - Go to flow's data directory, check where it is in "About" dialog, it's (~/.local/share/KDAB/flow/) on Linux
    - Add a Style.qml file there, you can now override style properties.
    - The complete list of properties is at: https://github.com/iamsergio/flow-pomodoro/blob/master/src/qml/DefaultStyle.qml

    Example file:

        import QtQuick 2.0
        import "qrc:/qml/"

        DefaultStyle {
            slackingText: "Flow" // Override "You're slacking" text
        }

    For mobile you'll want to inherit from MobileStyle instead of DefaultStyle.

2. How do I change the default title ("You're slacking") to something else ?
   Use the example file from question 1.

3. Where does flow look for plugins ?
   It looks in $QT_PLUGIN_PATH/flow/, <dir_containing_executable>/plugins/ and `qmake -query QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS`/flow/

4. Why doesn't pidgin plugin work ?
   You need to apply this patch: https://developer.pidgin.im/attachment/ticket/15824/patch.diff

5. How to use hardware acceleration on Windows ?
   Flow-pomodoro ships OpenGL32.dll from mesa project, which uses software rendering.
   If you think you have decent OpenGL graphic drivers simply delete the shipped OpenGL32.dll
   and flow will pick the system one. If you have nvidia or ATI chances are it will work.
   This question only applies if you downloaded the pre-built flow for windows.
